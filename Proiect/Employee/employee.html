            <p>
                An employee is an individual who was hired by an employer to do a specific job. 
                The employee is hired by the employer after an application and interview process results in his or her selection as an employee. 
                This selection occurs after the applicant is found by the employer to be the most qualified of their applicants to do the job for which they are hiring.
            </p>
            <p>
                The terms of an individual’s employment are specified by an offer letter, an employment contract, or verbally. 
                In a non-union workplace, every employee negotiates on their own; the terms of employment are not universal between all positions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many prospective employees do not negotiate at all by choosing to accept the offer that the employer makes to them. 
                Others ask for $5,000 - $10,000 more to see if they can start the job with a higher salary. 
                Since raises are subsequently based on the pay rate negotiated, it behooves a new employee to negotiate the best possible deal.
            </p>

            <p>
                In workplaces that are represented by a union, the collective bargaining agreement covers most aspects of an employee’s relationship with the workplace including compensation, benefits, hours of employment, sick time off, and vacation. The contract also protects the rights of the unionized employee and gives the employee options to grieving workplace treatment. The existence of the contract takes away the employee's individual right to negotiate his salary.
